// A repair's merge step (docs/repair.md, ADR 0002). Once its pull request passed CI and is ready for review, each Sandbox
// stage's journey gate runs at the pull request head, in pipeline order, through the gate manager's one-at-a-time queue
// over a checkout Perpetual owns; the managed source copy, the scan and the watched head never move. The pull request is
// squash-merged, naming the verified head so GitHub refuses one that moved, only when every gate passed at that head, no
// change rule held it, auto-merge is on, its head is still the verified one, every check on that head succeeded and the
// target branch has not moved since its base. A target branch that moved is merged into the repair branch through
// GitHub, and GitHub's merge commit goes through CI and the gates again, a bounded number of times. Anything else leaves
// the repair ready for a person, with the reason. A pull request the agent step could not mark ready for review still
// goes through the gates, and is marked ready once they were judged.
