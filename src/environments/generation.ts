// A detected stage's twin config, written by an agent and verified by building the twin (docs/SANDBOX.md, "Generated
// twin config"). The controller owns the loop: at most four attempts, each authored (../twin/authoring.ts), validated,
// then prepared as the environment's real twin, which counts only when it is ready, every app answers on its address and,
// when a service can, a test account exists. Why an attempt failed is the next attempt's feedback, staged and redacted:
// the stage it failed at, the app or service and its command, the error, the unwired variables of the config the next
// attempt starts from and the failed containers' logs; an attempt that ran out of time is one of them. A person sees a
// short error; the author's output goes to the logs.
