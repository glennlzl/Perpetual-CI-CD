Unit tests pass, CI is green, and sign-up or checkout is still broken. Perpetual catches that before the merge: it runs your real app with its real dependencies and walks through complete user journeys, then reports the result as a commit status your branch protection can require.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  push["Push to the target branch"] --> twin["Rebuild the Beta twin<br/>at that commit"]
  twin --> journeys["Replay the approved<br/>journey code"]
  journeys --> status["Post perpetual/Beta<br/>commit status"]
```

1. **Twin.** Perpetual builds a Docker Compose twin of your application from its own code, with each dependency supplied by the vendor's official local mode or sandbox: local Supabase, a Stripe sandbox with `stripe listen` (Perpetual can create one for you), Mailpit, a real model.
2. **Journeys.** A browser agent explores the running app and drafts two to four complete business journeys, such as *sign up → subscribe → use a paid feature → see credits decrease*. You review each journey's goal, milestones and checks; an agent then writes its actions as Playwright code, with no checks of its own. You approve the code, seeing it or its diff, after it passes three runs and a control run with every write blocked, which a reviewed check must catch.
3. **Gate.** On every push to the target branch, Perpetual rebuilds the twin at that commit, replays the reviewed journeys' approved code with no model and posts a `perpetual/<Stage>` commit status. A failed journey blocks promotion; a blocked or needs-review result, including a journey without approved code, waits for a person to release it; a pass promotes the commit.

## Why Perpetual

- **Real code, real services.** Official simulations come first; [vercel-labs/emulate](https://github.com/vercel-labs/emulate) is used only where a vendor has none, and no API is hand-mocked. Each twin shows where every dependency came from.
- **Business outcomes, not clicks.** A journey passes only when its reviewed checks observe the result. Generated code performs actions and never contains checks, and a missing account or integration is reported as blocked, never simulated.
- **Same commit, same verdict.** Runs replay approved code with no model and no automatic retries, so replaying a journey costs no tokens. A model is used once per journey, to draft it and write its code.
- **A gate, not a report.** The commit status plugs into branch protection, so a broken journey stops the merge.
- **Local-first.** The controller runs on your machine and binds to loopback. It polls GitHub instead of needing a webhook or public URL, never deploys, and never copies production credentials.

## Quickstart

Paste this into your coding agent, in the repository you want tested. It installs Perpetual, then follows [docs/onboarding.md](docs/onboarding.md) with you: connecting GitHub, choosing the branch to gate, what the twin can and cannot simulate in your application, and creating the Beta environment.

```text
Set up Perpetual (https://github.com/willlzl/Perpetual) for this repository: clone it outside this repository, run `npm run setup` in the clone and install anything it reports missing, then follow the clone's docs/onboarding.md with me, asking me its questions one at a time. Leave this repository unchanged, and ask me before you enter an API key or sign in anywhere.
```

Or by hand. Setup installs the dependencies, the interface, Chromium and the browser runtime, and names what the machine still lacks: Node.js 24.12+, Docker, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or the GitHub CLI.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/willlzl/Perpetual.git && cd Perpetual
npm run setup
node src/cli.ts serve --repo /path/to/your/app
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:4317>:

1. **Settings**: add an [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys). A model writes the twin config, drafts journeys and writes their code; runs use none.
2. **Connect GitHub** and choose the repository and target branch. The gate watches repositories chosen this way.
3. Add a **Beta** stage and choose **Create Beta environment**. An agent writes the twin config from the repository, and the first build takes a few minutes.
4. Review each drafted journey, then **Generate code**, **Verify code** and **Approve code** from its menu. Run it and watch the browser live.
5. Push to the target branch: `perpetual/Beta` appears on the commit. Require it in your branch protection rules.

## Status

> [!NOTE]
> Perpetual is a 0.1 alpha: one controller per machine, for web applications that can run under Docker Compose.

<summary>Twin services and their provenance</summary>

| Service | Provided by |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Mailpit, an LLM through OpenRouter | The actual service |
| Supabase, Stripe, Trigger.dev | The vendor's official local mode or sandbox |
| GitHub, Google, AWS, Linear, Vercel, Sign in with Apple | [vercel-labs/emulate](https://github.com/vercel-labs/emulate) |

</details>

Gate and manual runs replay approved Playwright code in a local Chromium with no model at run time; a manual run can also try a draft. An agent drafts journeys and writes their code, and a person approves code after 3 passing runs and a caught control run ([ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-gate-runs-approved-playwright-code.md)). Not yet available: repairing journey code after the app changes, a GitHub App or webhooks, hosted twins, and production deploys. The desktop sandbox is experimental. See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
